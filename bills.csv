SB 427,"A BILL TO BE ENTITLED AN ACT 1 To amend Article 7 of Chapter 4 of Title 49 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, 2 relating to Medicaid generally, so as to require the Department of Community Health to 3 engage an actuary to conduct an actuarial study of the fiscal impact of carving out pharmacy 4 benefits from the state's current Medicaid care management organizations; to provide for 5 actions based on the results of the actuarial study; to provide for submission of a waiver if 6 necessary; to provide for related matters; to provide for legislative findings; to repeal 7 conflicting laws; and for other purposes. 8 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA: 9 SECTION 1. 10 The General Assembly finds that: 11 (1) The Department of Community Health administers Medicaid benefits to Georgia's 12 aged, blind, and disabled directly through its fee-for-service program and offers Medicaid 13 benefits for low income beneficiaries and its children's health insurance program through 14 four Medicaid care management organizations (CMOs), along with benefits for children 15 in foster care receiving adoption assistance and select youth in the juvenile justice system, 16 through a single CMO; 17 (2) The State of Georgia should conduct an actuarial study to assess the potential savings 18 associated with carving out prescription drug benefits from its Medicaid managed care 19 delivery system and providing those benefits through its Medicaid fee-for-service 20 program; 21 (3) West Virginia carved out prescription drug benefits from its Medicaid managed care 22 delivery system and undertook providing prescription drug benefits through its 23 fee-for-service program. West Virginia's Medicaid actuary conducted an actuarial 24 assessment and found that the West Virginia carve out saved over $50 million in 2018; 25 (4) On November 5, 2019, three members of the Georgia General Assembly requested 26 that the Department of Community Health engage an actuary to conduct an actuarial 27 assessment and prepare a public report on the impact of a Medicaid managed care carve 20 LC 33 8208 S. B. 427 - 2 - 28 out of prescription drug benefits, with a goal of having the public report completed by the 29 second week of Georgia's 2020 legislative session; 30 (5) On November 26, 2019, the Department of Community Health declined the request 31 for the actuarial assessment and public report, indicating that it was unable to identify 32 appropriations or financial resources to conduct the assessment, which cost 33 approximately $150,000.00; 34 (6) In 2018, according to annual reports submitted to Georgia's insurance department by 35 Georgia's four CMOs: 36 (A) Their general administrative expenses were over $499.8 million; 37 (B) Their combined claim adjustment expenses were over $118 million; 38 (C) All four organizations contracted with affiliated entities for the provision of 39 administrative services; 40 (D) The combined underwriting gain for three of the CMOs was over $141 million, 41 with the fourth company showing an underwriting loss; and 42 (E) Dividends issued to parent companies of three of the four CMOs totaled $146 43 million. These CMOs also provide managed care services in Georgia under 44 non-Medicaid programs, and so it is not clear to the General Assembly exactly how 45 much of these dividends were derived from Georgia's Medicaid managed care program. 46 As a reference point, in 2018, approximately $3.6 billion of the $4.4 billion of net 47 income received by the three dividend-paying CMOs came from Georgia's Medicaid 48 managed care program; 49 (7) The Line 920 Report prepared for the chairmen of the House Appropriations 50 Committee and the Senate Appropriations Committee of the Georgia General Assembly 51 for state fiscal year 2018 found that: 52 (A) The practice of spread pricing resulted in a price differential between payments by 53 Medicaid CMOs to their pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and payments to 54 pharmacies of more than $50 million; and 55 (B) One CMO had a spread in excess of $29.8 million; 56 (8) Self-dealing between CMOs and their affiliated pharmacies or their contracted PBM 57 affiliated pharmacies raise concerns regarding conflict of interest. For example, based 58 on 2018 Medicaid claims data provided by the Department of Community Health: 59 (A) One CMO paid $24,772,230 on claims filled by its affiliated pharmacy out of a 60 total of $109,514,298 paid for claims. The CMO paid approximately 22 percent of its 61 total drug expenditure on claims filled by its affiliated pharmacy, despite the pharmacy 62 having just one in-state location and several out-of-state locations; 63 (B) Another CMO paid $12,402,679 on claims filled by its PBM affiliated pharmacy 64 out of a total of $91,822,324 paid for claims. The CMO paid approximately 13 percent 20 LC 33 8208 S. B. 427 - 3 - 65 of its total drug expenditure on claims filled by its PBM affiliated pharmacy, despite 66 the pharmacy having just one in-state location and several out-of-state locations; and 67 (C) One CMO's affiliated pharmacy filled all 300 units of imatinib, a drug used to treat 68 leukemia, which were paid for by the CMO for the year. That same CMO's affiliated 69 pharmacy also filled all 5,250 units of capecitabine, a drug used to treat cancer, which 70 were paid for by the CMO for the year. For another CMO, its contracted PBM 71 affiliated pharmacy filled all 480 units of imatinib, which were paid for by the CMO 72 for the year. That same CMO's contracted PBM affiliated pharmacy also filled all 73 4,858 units of capecitabine, which were paid for by the CMO for the year. 74 (9) In 2018, Georgia's Medicaid managed care program ranked in the bottom twenty-fifth 75 percentile in the nation for: 76 (A) Antidepressant medication management; 77 (B) Antipsychotic medication management for patients with schizophrenia; 78 (C) Medication management for patients with asthma; 79 (D) Statin adherence for patients with cardiovascular conditions; 80 (E) Statin adherence for patients with diabetes; and 81 (F) Controlling high blood pressure for cardiovascular conditions; 82 (10) Across all Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) performance 83 rankings in 2018: 84 (A) One CMO had 27 percent of its performance measure rates ranked below the 85 national Medicaid twenty-fifth percentile and 61.4 percent ranked below the national 86 Medicaid fiftieth percentile; and 87 (B) One CMO had 19.8 percent of its performance measure rates ranked below the 88 national Medicaid twenty-fifth percentile and 51.7 percent ranked below the national 89 Medicaid fiftieth percentile; 90 (11) The Department of Community Health administers prescription drug benefits in its 91 fee-for-service program in a transparent way, including its use of the publicly available 92 National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC) data published by the federal Centers 93 for Medicare and Medicaid Services and its use of a publicly available Select Specialty 94 Pharmacy Rate (SSPR); and 95 (12) Due to high administrative costs, self-dealing, a lack of transparency, and poor 96 performance, CMOs no longer have the trust of the General Assembly in connection with 97 the administration of prescription drug benefits, and the General Assembly believes that 98 the Department of Community Health's fee-for-service program being more transparent 99 and efficient will make it better equipped to administer prescription drug benefits for all 100 Georgia beneficiaries moving forward. 20 LC 33 8208 S.

The department shall cooperate fully with such 110 actuarial study, including making its records and the records of any contractors and 111 subcontractors available to the actuary. 112 (b) If the results of the actuarial study project a potential annual savings to the state and 113 federal government combined of $20 million or more, then on and after July 1, 2021: 114 (1) The department shall provide the pharmacy benefits for a care management 115 organization's members, and care management organizations shall not provide pharmacy 116 benefits for their enrolled members; provided, however, that a care management 117 organization shall have access to the department's pharmacy data for its enrolled 118 members; and 119 (2) The department shall calculate an amount equal to 7.5 percent of a care management 120 organization's net underwriting gain for the July 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021, contract year, 121 as determined by the department's Medicaid actuary, and shall reduce the care 122 management organization's subsequent contract term payment by such amount, for use 123 by the department in providing pharmacy benefits for care management organization 124 members, including any cost incurred in program implementation. 125 (c) If the results of the actuarial study project a potential annual savings to the state and 126 federal government combined of at least $10 million but less than $20 million, the 127 department shall have the authority but not the obligation to proceed with a carve out as set 128 forth in subsection (b) of this Code section. In making its decision, the department may 129 consider other factors, including transparency, economic benefits to the state of proceeding 130 with a carve out, and the costs associated with providing increased oversight should the 131 CMOs continue to administer pharmacy benefits for their enrolled members. 132 (d) The department shall submit any necessary modifications, if applicable, to the state 133 plan for medical assistance filed pursuant to Code Section 49-4-12 in order to fulfill the 134 requirements of this Code section."" 135 SECTION 3. 136 All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.",2,regular,Mullis of the 53rd,Health and Human Services
